唉，我果然是不适合放假，感觉自己一个寒假都颓了过去.

高中三年貌似一直没有一个真正的假期，要不然就搞竞赛要不然就补课。

呀，今天是情人节

呀，时间好晚了呀

只能以后再更了，待更（话说根本就没人看吧，待催更）

又是一个周六，适当放松+课外拓展的日子就这样被我虚度了。

浑浑噩噩，做白日梦，沉迷游戏，这样的状态是我想要的吗？我怎么了？

这几天一连遇到许多需要思考、需要解答的问题，但等待我的却是思考无果

遇到问题或许第一选择不是去苦思答案？也许关键在于好好描述问题，改变问题（《院士思维》上的启示：试图证明“条件A->结论X”，不妨试试多举例子，正例或许会坚定信念，遇到反例也不要着急、不要放弃，或许只是改改条件，改改结论，改成证明“条件B->结论Y”就好了。许多问题不都是这样迭代解决的吗？）

需要强制戒毒了。需要用自控力让自己先走在路上再说。
